# CS300


    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem I was trying to solve in this course was the choice of which data structure would best serve given a specific scenario. The scenario that I was given was to create a data structure which would store school courses and their prerequisites. I was able to choose between a vector list, hast table, or binary search tree. 

    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

My approach to solving this problem was data-driven. I chose to analyze the Big-O Notation for the runtime analysis of each data structure if it was used to solve the problem. Ultimately, I determined that a hash table had the greatest efficiency given what the most frequent operations (adding, printing, and deleting courses) would be. Hash Tables are capable of 0(1) efficiency when completing these operations. 

    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    
The primary roadblock I encountered was creating an efficient search method for the hash table because I had to first understand its function and limitations. The search method is used to output a specific course and to delete courses, so it needed to be as efficient as possible. I was able to complete this by taking advantage of key assignment based on the actual course number. This was both simple and efficient while mantaining 0(1) operation efficiency. 

    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    
The work I completed in this course helped me better understand the advantages and disadvantages of data storage methods and their uses. By having direct experience and analysis of the runtimes for each type, I can now understand why the data structure is so important, especially for large projects. 

    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
